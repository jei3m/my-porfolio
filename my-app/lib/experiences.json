        "description": "This is my first time I get to experience programming. Starting with C++, where I learned the basics such as input and output operations, basic mathematical functions, and conditional statements like if and else. In addition to programming, I worked extensively with AutoCAD, creating detailed 2D floor plans of various sizes and layouts. For my 3D projects in AutoCAD, I successfully designed digital models of fundamental parts such as frames and casings. These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation, providing me the skills and knowledge that I constantly apply up to this day. It applies both programming and digital design, which enhances my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.",

I got introduced to basic html and css, and this is where I got exposed to full-stack development for the first time.  We are tasked to create a full-stack project using python and Django REST framework as our backend. This is where I also got study about electronics, what are the various components, what they do, and how they should applied. Though it is more on a textbook approach I have yet to experience handling electronics later on. Throughout the 2nd semester of this school year, we are tasked to study React.js and this is where my interest to front-end design has started. ",
