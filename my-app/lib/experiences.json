        "description": "This is my first time I get to experience programming. Starting with C++, where I learned the basics such as input and output operations, basic mathematical functions, and conditional statements like if and else. In addition to programming, I worked extensively with AutoCAD, creating detailed 2D floor plans of various sizes and layouts. For my 3D projects in AutoCAD, I successfully designed digital models of fundamental parts such as frames and casings. These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation, providing me the skills and knowledge that I constantly apply up to this day. It applies both programming and digital design, which enhances my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.",

I got introduced to basic html and css, and this is where I got exposed to full-stack development for the first time.  We are tasked to create a full-stack project using python and Django REST framework as our backend. This is where I also got study about electronics, what are the various components, what they do, and how they should be applied. Though it is more on a textbook approach I have yet to experience handling electronics later on. Throughout the 2nd semester of this school year, we are tasked to study React.js and this is where my interest to front-end design has started. ",

We mostly focused on the front-end aspect of web development, specifically using only HTML and CSS. We were given an individual task as well to create an about me website using those two languages mentioned earlier, though there is some JavaScript involved for the animations. This is the school year that I also got exposed to Arduino, we started to use different types of sensors, and components and got to write and upload code to our module using the Arduino IDE.",

This was the time I got interested in electronic projects, using different microcontrollers, and development boards. My first-ever project with that mentioned is the ESP32 Marauder. Wherein I ported the firmware online, making it compatible with my ESP32 development board, and flashed it successfully. Time will tell what projects I will work on, what languages I'll study, and what components I'll tinker with. I'm always invested in learning all things about tech and applying them in the very projects I will work on in the future.",
